\section{Sprints}

Division into sprints of the development cycle.

\subsection{Sprint 1}
Sprint 1 should take 1.5 days.\\
This time will be used to review further the application organisation, and review algorithms to encrypt/unencrypt file.\\
It will contain the initialisation of the application code structure.\\
The implementation of reading and processing method for 2 dimensional matrix of integers representation file.\\
    \begin{itemize}
        \item 1 - Project structure
        \item 6 - File processor
    \end{itemize}

\subsection{Sprint 2}
Sprint 2 should take around 3.5 days.\\
This time will be used to review possibilities between pattern search algorithm, and data structure optimising research.\\
Implementation of an optimised Matrice data structure.\\
Implementation of 3 types research algorithms responding to requested features.\\
Testing of project criteria.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item 3 - Matrice
        \item 5 - Search features
    \end{itemize}

\subsection{Sprint 3}
Sprint 3 should take around 1.5 day.\\
It implies the implementation of the command line interface.\\
The implementation of search operations management used by CLI.\\
Testing and validation of full workflow.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item 2 - Command line interface
        \item 4 - Operations management
        \item Workflow validation
    \end{itemize}
